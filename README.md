# code-quiz
This is the read me for my code-quiz.

In this quiz I apply my knowledge I have learned to this point in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

You will start the quiz by clicking the start quiz button.

You will be provided with a total of 5 questions and 75 seconds to answer the questions.

Once the time has run to 0 or you have answered all the questions the highscore screen will be displayed.

You will not know if your score is better than the highscores until you enter your initials.

Thank you for playing!
